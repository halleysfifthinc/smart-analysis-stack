# SMART Analysis Stack

SMART Analysis Stack is a collection of MATLAB functions and scripts used by the SMART Senior Design team at [LeTourneau University](http://www.letu.edu).

## About

The treatment of neuromuscular dysfunctions in children through physical therapy is a lengthy process. [Amtryke tricycles](www.amtrykestore.com) are used by physical therapists as a low-cost, but high-volume form of pediatric therapy for many neuromuscular disabilities. The SMART team performed research on the effectiveness of the Amtryke tricycles from based on kinematic (mocap) data gathered from volunteers.

This collection is comprised of two main scripts: one used to calculate the independent variable for trial data, [`handlebar_angles.m`](https://github.com/halleysfifthinc/smart-analysis-stack/blob/master/handlebar_angles.m), and another to analyze the finished data, [`test_gui.m`](https://github.com/halleysfifthinc/smart-analysis-stack/blob/master/test_gui.m).
